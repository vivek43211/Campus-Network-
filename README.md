# University Campus Network 

## üìå Project Overview
This project simulates the **University Network Infrastructure** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. Albion University has **two campuses** located 20 miles apart:  
- **Main Campus** ‚Äì Hosts Administrative departments, Faculties (Business, Engineering/Computing, Art & Design), IT Department, and Student Labs.  
- **Branch Campus(Small Campus)** ‚Äì Hosts the Faculty of Health & Sciences with separate networks for staff and students.  

The objective was to design and configure a **scalable, secure, and functional campus network** following hierarchical network design principles and Cisco CCNA concepts.

## üè´ Network Case Study & Requirements
- **Main Campus**  
  - **Building A:** Administrative staff (Management, HR, Finance) and Faculty of Business. Shared networking equipment with VLAN segmentation.  
  - **Building B:** Faculty of Engineering & Computing (E&C) and Faculty of Art & Design (A&D).  
  - **Building C:** Student labs and IT Department (hosts internal servers such as Web server).  

- **Branch Campus**  
  - **Faculty of Health & Sciences (H&S):** Separate VLANs and networks for staff and students.  

- **External Connectivity**  
  - Email Server hosted in the **Cloud**.  
  - Routers use **RIPv2** for dynamic routing internally and **Static Routing** for external cloud server access.  

- **General Requirements**  
  - Each department/faculty on its own IP subnet.  
  - VLANs and port security implemented on switches.  
  - DHCP for dynamic IP allocation in Building A.  
  - Inter-VLAN routing via Router-on-a-Stick.  
  - SSH for secure remote device management.

## üì° Additional Functionalities
Beyond the requirements, additional wireless functionality was added:  
- **Building A (Admin):** Wireless Access Point for staff mobile devices and laptops.  
- **Building C (IT Lab):** Access Point for students‚Äô laptops.  
- **Branch Campus (Staff):** Wireless AP for faculty/staff laptops.  

This ensures **mobility and flexible network access** for staff and students.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Process

### **1. Device Setup & Cabling**
- Placed routers, switches, PCs, laptops, servers, and access points in Packet Tracer.  
- Used correct cabling: straight-through for PCs-to-switch, cross-over for switch-to-switch, fiber for backbone links.  

### **2. VLAN Configuration**
- Created VLANs on all switches (10, 20, 30 ‚Ä¶ 100).  
- Assigned switch ports to corresponding VLANs based on department.  
- Configured trunk links between switches and routers.  

### **3. Subnetting & IP Addressing**
- Designed subnets for each department based on /24 addressing.  
- Assigned default gateways (router sub-interfaces for Router-on-a-Stick).  
- Configured servers with static IP addresses.  

### **4. Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)**
- Configured router sub-interfaces with encapsulation dot1q for each VLAN.  
- Assigned IP addresses as gateways.  

### **5. DHCP Configuration**
- Configured the Main Campus Router as a DHCP server.  
- Created DHCP pools for departments in **Building A** (Admin, HR, Finance, Business).  
- Excluded gateway and server addresses.  

### **6. Routing**
- Enabled **RIPv2** on routers for dynamic routing between campuses.  
- Configured **Static Routes** for external Email Server in the Cloud.  

### **7. Wireless Configuration**
- Deployed Access Points in Admin, IT Lab, and Branch Staff areas.  
- Configured SSIDs and connected laptops/smartphones.  

### **8. Security**
- Configured **SSH** on routers and switches for remote access.  
- Enabled **port-security** on access ports (limited MAC addresses, sticky MAC).  

### **9. Testing & Verification**
- Verified DHCP leases with PCs in Building A.  
- Tested **ping & traceroute** across VLANs and campuses.  
- Verified wireless connectivity with laptops and smartphones.  
- Checked **RIP routing tables** with `show ip route`.  
- Verified SSH login from Admin PC to Router/Switch.  
- Ensured Cloud Email Server communication via static route.

## ‚úÖ Testing & Results
- **Inter-VLAN communication:** Success.  
- **DHCP allocation in Building A:** Success.  
- **SSH remote access:** Success.  
- **RIP routing tables exchanged:** Success.  
- **Wireless laptop/smartphone access:** Success.  
- **Connectivity with Cloud Email Server:** Success.
